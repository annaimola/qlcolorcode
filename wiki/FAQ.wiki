Here are some questions I expect to get.

  # *How will I know when a new version is released?*
    Some day google code will have RSS feeds, but until then your best bet is to subscribe to [http://www.n8gray.org/blog/category/projects/qlcolorcode/feed the QLColorCode RSS feed] on my blog.  You can do this in Mail.app, for example.  You can also use the [http://rssfwd.com RSS FWD] service to have that feed forwarded to you as e-mail if you're not hot on RSS (but really, you should be).
  # *How do I uninstall QLColorCode?*
    Just drag the bundle from `~/Library/QuickLook` or `/Library/QuickLook` into the trash.
  # *Why doesn't it highlight my Bozoscript .bozo files?*
    The plugin tells the system, "I can display anything of type public.source-code" but it's up to the system to figure out what extensions, mime-types, and such have that type.  For extensions like .c or .py the system already knows that they're source code, but for .bozo and other "exotic" file types somebody needs to tell it.  I've included a few random "interesting" file types in the Info.plist file in the plugin's bundle to take care of this, but it's probably not wise to include everything that Highlight can handle.  Why not?  Well, if two different entities make conflicting claims on a given file extension then only one of them can win.  For the gritty details, see [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/understanding_utis/index.html Apple's UTI docs] and [http://lists.apple.com/archives/Quicklook-dev/2007/Nov/msg00043.html this message].
  # *Can you add support for Bozoscript?*
    [http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight_langs.html If it's supported by Highlight] then the answer is probably yes.  If it's not supported by highlight then the answer is also probably yes, but only if you're willing to write the highlight support.  Assuming the language is supported by highlight, I'll need some info about the language in order to create a Universal Type Identifier for it:
      # The name of the language
      # The file extension(s) it uses
      # The website of the organization in charge of the language (if possible)
      # (optional but potentially very helpful) The Info.plist file from a major Mac software package that handles files of this language.
  # *I hate the default style!  How do I change it?*
    Take a look at `Contents/Resources/colorize.sh` inside the plugin bundle, and try changing `theme=ide-xcode` to one of the other themes listed.  I would like to make it easier to customize this, but I don't know when I'll have time.  Patches would be appreciated!
  # *I thought QLColorCode used [http://pygments.org Pygments] as its highlighting engine.*
    Sorry, that's not a question.  :-)  Actually, it did use Pygments, but now it uses Highlight.  Pygments is a nice project, but the Highlight engine is about 10x faster and supports more languages.  One nice aspect of QLColorCode's design is that the highlighting engine can be swapped out quite easily if something better comes along.
