Here are some questions I expect to get.

  # *How do I uninstall QLColorCode?*
    Just drag the bundle from `~/Library/QuickLook` or `/Library/QuickLook` into the trash.
  # *Why doesn't it highlight my bozoscript .bozo files?*
    The plugin tells the system, "I can display anything of type public.source-code" but it's up to the system to figure out what extensions, mime-types, and such have that type.  For extensions like .c or .py the system already knows that they're source code, but for .bozo and other "exotic" file types somebody needs to tell it.  I've included a few random "interesting" file types in the Info.plist file in the plugin's bundle to take care of this, but it's probably not wise to include everything that Pygments can handle.  Why not?  Well, if two different entities make conflicting claims on a given file extension then only one of them can win.  For the gritty details, see [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/understanding_utis/index.html Apple's UTI docs] and [http://lists.apple.com/archives/Quicklook-dev/2007/Nov/msg00043.html this message].
  # *I hate the default style!  How do I change it?*
    Take a look at `Contents/Resources/colorize.sh` inside the plugin bundle, and try changing `style=nautumn` to one of the other styles listed.  I would like to make it easier to customize this, but I don't know when I'll have time.  Patches would be appreciated!
