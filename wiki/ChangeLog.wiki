{{{
0.2:
    - Switched from Pygments to Highlight.  This should increase speed *and*
        language coverage.
    - Added thumbnailing support
    - Changed .tex UTI to agree with TeXShop's.
    - (Try to) let the system pick a different plugin if ours fails
    - Added UTIs for .css, .sql, .erl, and .sml
